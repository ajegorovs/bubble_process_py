General comments/ideas:
- distStatPredictionVect2 function is too complex.
- relax all criterium on inlet side.
- frozens might not change to other types and back.
- split frozen into high and low likelyhood fr bubbes using temporal stat.

change boundRectAngle to atan2

Global:
predictCentroidDiff2- implement local, last step version so program does not have fetch big array.
predictHullArea - same
distCheck2Sigma, areaCrit make them update from statistis as calc

lastNStepsFrozenHullAreas - check if this actually works- FB from much earier steps are identified
l_bubble_type is done multiple times. may be relict of when fb were managed with RB and Dist B

check these lines long-term!:
	assert type(fID) == list, ' you need a line below! '

	newFoundBubsElse = [A for A in newFoundBubsElse if A not in elseOldNewDist[:,1] and A not in frozenOldGlobNewLoc.keys()]; frozenOldGlobNewLoc now mixed,and needs new gID for int FR
