General comments/ideas:
- distStatPredictionVect2 function is too complex.: but deos the job.
- relax all criterium on inlet side. x - filtered out inlet IDs, for now.
- frozens might not change to other types and back. : not yet confirmed 100%
- split frozen into high and low likelyhood fr bubbes using temporal stat.
- statistics on bubble parameters were supposed to converge from more relaxed inital limits to something stationary.
	this might not be the best option, since bubbles may start to change rapidly.

	add hull data to storage for drawing. due to alphashape
	radialEllipse stuff is not needed if there is a perfect match. should make a local switch to do it once if required.
16/02/23:
	change boundRectAngle to atan2

Global:
predictCentroidDiff2- implement local, last step version so program does not have fetch big array.
predictHullArea - same
distCheck2Sigma, areaCrit make them update from statistis as calc

lastNStepsFrozenHullAreas - check if this actually works- FB from much earier steps are identified
l_bubble_type is done multiple times. may be relict of when fb were managed with RB and Dist B

l_areas_hull_old    = {**l_RBub_areas_hull_old,   **l_DBub_areas_hull_old,    **l_FBub_areas_hull_old}- has more IDs than other!!
check these lines long-term!:
	assert type(fID) == list, ' you need a line below! '

	newFoundBubsElse = [A for A in newFoundBubsElse if A not in elseOldNewDist[:,1] and A not in frozenOldGlobNewLoc.keys()]; frozenOldGlobNewLoc now mixed,and needs new gID for int FR
