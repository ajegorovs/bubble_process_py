General comments/ideas:
-distStatPredictionVect2 function is too complex.
-relax all criterium on inlet side.

Global:
predictCentroidDiff2- implement local, last step version so program does not have fetch big array.
predictHullArea - same
distCheck2Sigma, areaCrit make them update from statistis as calc

lastNStepsFrozenHullAreas - check if this actually works- FB from much earier steps are identified
l_bubble_type is done multiple times. may be relict of when fb were managed with RB and Dist B
