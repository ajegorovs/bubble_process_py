TODO:
27.09.23 (major) implement final pass / extension of segment start/end 

28.09.23 (minor)	not sure if "rudamentary split/merge analysis based on nearest neighbor connectedness symmetry" is needed. might anaylze unidirected graph degrees instead
					although to differentiate splits and merges, have to understand time directions

29.09.23 (major) (# search for conflict nodes for extended branches) method needs testing. currently its on trigger.
29.09.23 (# search for conflict nodes for extended branches) method needs further develpment in cases of multiple solutions.


DONE:
29.09.23 - 27.09.23 extension of split branches havent been done yet. no test data
